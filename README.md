# 🐦 Twimba

Hello there! 👋 Twimba is a lightweight Twitter-style feed built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — a fast, minimal project that focuses on state-driven rendering and event delegation.

Originally a DOM challenge, I pushed it into a fully functional mini-app: tweets render from data, likes/retweets toggle with instant UI updates, replies expand/collapse, and new tweets get unique IDs via uuid.
